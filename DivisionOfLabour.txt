# ~/denkr/Documents/School/College/UCD/'5. BIOE-3040-H01 - BioMechanics'/Matlab/BiomechanicsExam2 text
# File: DivisionOfLabour.txt
# Authors:
# - Neil A. Kumar    
# - Linea Gutierrez  
# - Elise Carter

## -- Purpose -- ##
The purpose of this file is to dictate how work for the take home portion 
of Exam 2 in Dr. Kendall Hunter's Introduction to Biomechanics class 
(BIOE-3040-H01) will be divided amongst the three of us. This file will 
also serve to document who does what work, without regard for the initial 
assignment.


## -- Format -- ##

Each group member will provide two signatures at the bottom of this 
document: the first to indicate that the written assignments were agreed 
to, the second to indicate that the document acurately represents who did 
what work.
